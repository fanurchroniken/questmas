## Theme Customization per Quest Type

Captain's Quest supports unique styling themes for each quest type to enhance the user experience and brand differentiation. For example:

- **Christmas Calendar Treasure Hunts (B2C):**  
  - Themes may include festive colors (reds, greens, golds), holiday-themed icons, snowy or warm cozy background textures.  
  - Styling encourages seasonal spirit and sharing vibrancy to drive virality.

- **Virtual Treasure Hunts (B2B):**  
  - Themes can be tailored to corporate branding or the nature of the training/event (e.g., sleek modern for tech, playful for creative industries).  
  - Customizable colors, icon sets, and layouts per quest campaign enable unique experiences for each client.

- **Additional Quest Types:**  
  - Each can have its own visual style and thematic assets, adjustable by administrators or quest creators via theme engine.  
  - This modular theming supports better engagement, contextual immersion, and brand alignment.

Themes include full control of:  
- Primary and secondary colors  
- Backgrounds and textures  
- Icons and illustrations  
- Fonts and typography scaling  
- UI element style variations (buttons, cards, inputs)

This flexibility supports Captain's Quest's vision as a modular SaaS for diverse applications with viral B2C focus and customized B2B deployments.

## Tone of Voice

**Overall tone**

- Friendly, adventurous, and collaborative  
- Same core tone for B2C and B2B; only adjust formality slightly by channel  

**Key principles**

- Prefer “you” and “we” over formal third-person  
- Use simple, concrete language with light pirate/adventure flavor  
- Sprinkle, but do not overuse, themed words (crew, captain, treasure, map, quest)  

**Examples – in-app**

- Onboarding: “Welcome aboard, Captain! Your first quest is ready.”  
- Error: “This map looks a bit off. Try again or choose a different path.”  
- Success: “Treasure found! You’ve unlocked the next quest.”  

**Examples – B2B**

- Landing page: “Turn onboarding into an adventure your new hires actually enjoy.”  
- Feature section: “Design guided treasure hunts that lead your crew through tools, culture, and rituals.”  

---

## Social & Marketing

**Visual approach**

- Use the pirate & Caribbean palette in social tiles and ads  
- Combine UI screenshots with illustrated treasure-map elements or island frames  
- Highlight real-world gifts, team photos, and quest progress where possible  

**Copy approach**

- Short, energetic headlines with clear outcomes  
  - “Turn December into a treasure hunt.”  
  - “Onboard your crew with quests, not PDFs.”  
- Strong CTAs: “Start your first quest”, “Invite your crew”, “Share your map”  

---

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background (aim WCAG AA or better)  
- Avoid relying on color alone to indicate state (use icons, labels, and patterns)  
- Provide clear focus states for keyboard navigation  
- Keep language simple and avoid overly obscure pirate lingo

## Thematic Internal Schema Naming

Captain's Quest supports thematic renaming of core schema elements to better fit the narrative and audience of each quest type while maintaining internal consistency and clarity.

| Hierarchy Level | Internal Schema | B2C (Adventurous / Playful Theme)      | B2B (Professional / Corporate Theme)   | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Top Level       | Quest           | Quest / Adventure / Voyage             | Quest / Journey / Campaign             | The overarching container; defines the narrative, schedule, and scope of the overall experience. |
| Mid Level       | Chapter         | Voyage / Episode / Expedition          | Module / Stage / Phase                 | A segment grouping tasks; useful for multi-day or multi-topic quests; optional but structuring.  |
| Unit Level      | Task            | Challenge / Riddle / Clue              | Step / Activity / Task                 | The atomic unit of engagement; one puzzle, activity, or clue to solve.                            |
| Micro Level     | Action          | Move / Discovery / Trick               | Interaction / Response / Action       | The smallest required input; how the user completes a Task (e.g., answer, scan, click).          |
| Outcome Level   | Reward          | Treasure / Gift / Badge                | Reward / Outcome / Recognition        | The payoff for completion; can be scoped at Task, Chapter, or Quest level.                        |
| Meta Layer      | Analytics       | Captain’s Log / Progress Map           | Analytics / Dashboard / Report        | Tracking progress, completion, engagement metrics.                                               |
| Meta Layer      | Branding        | Theme / Pirate Skin / Map              | Branding / Corporate Identity         | Controls visual identity; playful skins for consumers, professional branding for enterprises.    |
| Meta Layer      | Schedule        | Daily Unlock / Countdown               | Timeline / Workflow / Schedule        | Defines timing rules; e.g., daily riddles for Advent, structured workflows for onboarding.       |

### Flexible Theming per Quest

Each quest type can independently define and customize its core schema namings to create a fully branded and immersive experience. This enables:

- B2C quests to adopt playful, story-driven language aligning with their adventurous, viral nature.
- B2B quests to use professional, structured terminology suited to corporate contexts.
- Administrators and quest creators can customize naming to suit specific campaigns or branding needs via the theme engine.

### Implementation Guidance

- Internally, canonical schema names remain consistent (e.g., Quest, Chapter, Task, Action) for system stability.
- The presentation layer or API can map these canonical names to themed terms dynamically based on the quest’s active theme.
- Documentation and user-facing interfaces reflect the themed vocabulary to enhance engagement and clarity.
- Analytics and meta-layers maintain neutral canonical naming while reporting on all themed variants.
