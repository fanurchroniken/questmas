## Part 1: Foundational Principles

### 1.1 Production Readiness Standards

The agent must ensure all code meets production-ready standards:

- **Robustness**: Code must handle edge cases, errors, and failures gracefully without silent failures
- **Security**: All security best practices must be implemented (input validation, authentication, authorization, data protection)
- **Performance**: Code must be optimized for speed and resource efficiency
- **Scalability**: Architecture must support horizontal and vertical scaling
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and error tracking capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Code must be clean, well-organized, and easily understood by other developers
- **Documentation**: All components must be thoroughly documented with clear examples
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests)

### 1.2 Code Quality Standards

All generated code must adhere to strict quality standards:

- **Readability**: Use consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, and self-documenting code
- **Simplicity**: Prefer explicit, straightforward solutions over clever abstractions
- **Modularity**: Break functionality into small, focused, reusable components
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid code duplication through proper abstraction
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- **No Silent Failures**: Always log and handle errors explicitly; never use empty catch blocks

### 1.3 Development Philosophy

- **Vibe Coding Methodology**: Write code conversationally with clear intent, favoring readable patterns over optimization micro-details
- **API-First Design**: Design with APIs and integrations in mind from the start
- **BYOK Support**: Build systems that work with bring-your-own-key (BYOK) patterns for user control
- **No-Code Ready**: Structure code to enable low-code/no-code integrations and configurations

---

## Part 2: Architecture & Design Patterns

### 2.1 Recommended Architecture Patterns

Choose the appropriate pattern based on application requirements:
<!--
#### Layered Architecture (N-Tier)
- **Best for**: Monolithic applications with clear separation of concerns
- **Components**: Presentation layer → Business logic layer → Data access layer → Infrastructure
- **Guidelines**:
  - Each layer communicates only with adjacent layers
  - Higher layers depend on lower layers, never vice versa
  - Keep layers thin and focused
  - Apply dependency injection for loose coupling
-->
#### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- **Best for**: Applications requiring technology flexibility and high testability
- **Components**: Core domain logic → Ports (interfaces) → Adapters (implementations)
- **Guidelines**:
  - Isolate business logic from external concerns
  - Define clear ports for all external dependencies
  - Implement adapters for databases, APIs, message queues, etc.
  - Enable seamless technology swapping without affecting core logic
<!--
#### Microservices Architecture
- **Best for**: Large, scalable systems with independent deployment requirements
- **Guidelines**:
  - Each service owns its data
  - Services communicate via well-defined APIs or event streams
  - Implement service discovery and load balancing
  - Design for resilience with retry logic and circuit breakers

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Best for**: Systems requiring real-time processing and loose coupling
- **Components**: Event producers → Event bus/brokers → Event consumers
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use pub/sub patterns for asynchronous communication
  - Implement event sourcing for audit trails
  - Design for eventual consistency
  - Ensure idempotent message processing

#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Best for**: Complex business domains requiring clear modeling
- **Guidelines**:
  - Define bounded contexts with clear boundaries
  - Use ubiquitous language across development and business teams
  - Separate core domain logic from supporting functionality
  - Implement aggregates for consistency boundaries

### 2.2 Design Patterns

Apply proven design patterns for common problems:

- **Factory Pattern**: For creating complex objects with multiple configurations
- **Strategy Pattern**: For encapsulating interchangeable algorithms
- **Observer Pattern**: For decoupling event producers from consumers
- **Decorator Pattern**: For adding functionality without modifying existing code
- **Repository Pattern**: For abstracting data access logic
- **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**: For managing dependencies
- **Builder Pattern**: For constructing complex objects step-by-step
- **Adapter Pattern**: For integrating incompatible interfaces

## Part 3: Development Workflow

### 3.1 Git Practices

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
  - Example: `feat(auth): implement JWT token validation`
- Make small, logical commits
- Keep feature branches short-lived (1-3 days)
- Require pull request reviews before merge

### 3.2 Branching Strategy

- **Main branch**: Production-ready code
- **Develop branch**: Integration branch for features
- **Feature branches**: `feature/feature-name`
- **Bugfix branches**: `bugfix/issue-description`
- **Release branches**: `release/v1.0.0`

### 3.3 CI/CD Pipeline

Automation must include:
- Automated linting (ESLint, Prettier)
- Automated testing (unit, integration)
- Code coverage checks
- Security scanning (dependency vulnerabilities, SAST)
- Build validation
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production deployment

## Part 4: Vibe Coding Agent Guidelines

### 4.1 Prompt Construction

When providing instructions to the AI agent:

- **Be Specific**: Clearly state requirements and expected behavior
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant codebase patterns and standards
- **Ask for Plans First**: Request the agent to outline its approach before implementation
- **Use Examples**: Provide code examples of preferred patterns
- **Reference Standards**: Point to techstack.md and codingInstructions.md for implementation details

### 4.2 Agent Interaction Pattern

1. **Define the Feature**
   - Clear functional requirements
   - User stories or acceptance criteria
   - Edge cases to handle

2. **Request Architecture Plan**
   - Ask agent to outline components
   - Request explanation of design decisions
   - Validate plan aligns with project standards

3. **Implement with Testing**
   - Request implementation with tests
   - Ask for error handling and validation
   - Ensure documentation is included

4. **Review & Iterate**
   - Review code for standards compliance
   - Request corrections if needed
   - Validate against techstack and coding instructions

### 4.3 Error Prevention

To minimize agent mistakes:

- Include project structure overview
- Reference similar implementations in codebase
- Specify exact file paths and naming conventions
- Include relevant environment setup instructions
- Point to existing utilities and services to reuse

- **Webhook Support**: Allow external systems to subscribe to events
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect services from overload

---

## Part 7: Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Testing Philosophy

- **Test Pyramid**: Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation when appropriate
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Focus on business requirements
- **Continuous Testing**: Automated tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Quality Gates**: Enforce coverage and quality thresholds

### 7.2 Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 80-100% coverage of business logic
