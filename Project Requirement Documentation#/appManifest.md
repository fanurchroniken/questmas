<!--
AppManifest is the single source of truth for high-level metadata and intent of the project.
Use this to convey what the app is, who it is for, and any non-negotiable requirements or foundational context.
This file should be concise, descriptive, and kept up to date as the project evolves.

## Purpose & Goals

- Admin portal for configuration/tracking
- Participant UI for quest progression and reward reveal

## Non-Goals / Out of Scope
